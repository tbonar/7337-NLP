    "Vocabulary size and lexical diversity in combination are a better measurement of text difficulty and reading level than by themselves. When separated, they only provide a reader insight into only part of the picture for a text. For instance, when examining lexical diversity, we are shown a view on ‘textual richness’, the ratio of unique vocabulary to the total number of words, however, this metric alone does not work well when considering larger texts as we tend to repeat functional words such as pronouns, articles, and conjunction words. However, if we add in vocabulary size from our previous two questions, we can see that McGuffey’s Fourth Eclectic Reader contains a considerable increase in vocabulary (twice, in fact) when comparing to its previous volume. This difference indicates to an unfamiliar reader, such as a younger or language student, that although the lexical diversity is similar between the Third and Fourth volumes, the Fourth volume increases the vocabulary size by two-fold while maintaining a similar overall complexity.\n"
